## Description
The purpose of this project was to learn how to create a React application. Starter-kit contained the required css, and necessary dependencies to run a React application locally. A Static HTML index file was also included to be used as a template for the building of the project. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to search and organize books fetched via API. After searching, the books can either be placed or moved amongst 3 shelves. Books can also be removed from any of the shelves by selecting the 'none' option. The main idea is to be able to organize and keep track of books by showing their info and cover into the states of "Currently reading", "Want to read", or "Read".
